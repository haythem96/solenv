![Github Actions](https://github.com/memester-xyz/solenv/workflows/test/badge.svg)

## Installation

```
forge install memester-xyz/solenv
```

## Usage

Firstly, it's very important that you do not commit your `.env` file. So, it goes without saying, but add it to your `.gitignore`! This repo has one only for an example.

## Contributing

Clone this repo and run:
```
forge install
```

Make sure all tests pass, add new ones if needed:
```
forge test
```

## Why?

[Forge scripting](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/solidity-scripting.html) is becoming more popular. With Solenv your scripts are even more powerful and natural to work with.

## Development

This project uses [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh). See the [book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.html) for instructions on how to install and use Foundry.
